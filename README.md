## Getting Started

Follow these steps to integrate the Navigation Bar Component into your project:

1. **Download**: Download the `navbar` folder from this repository.

2. **Include Files**: In the `<head>` section of your HTML file, include the provided CSS and JavaScript files:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="navbar/css/navbar.css">
   <script src="navbar/js/navbar.js"></script>
   ```

3. **HTML Structure**: Add the following HTML structure to your navigation bar:

   ```html
   <nav class="navbar">
       <div class="navbar-brand">
           <!-- Your logo or site title -->
       </div>
       <ul class="navbar-nav">
           <!-- Add your navigation items here -->
       </ul>
   </nav>
   ```

4. **Configure Navigation Items**: Replace the placeholder navigation items with your actual navigation links. You can also add dropdown menus:

   ```html
   <ul class="navbar-nav">
       <li class="nav-item"><a href="#">Home</a></li>
       <li class="nav-item dropdown">
           <a href="#">Services</a>
           <ul class="dropdown-menu">
               <li><a href="#">Web Design</a></li>
               <li><a href="#">Graphic Design</a></li>
               <!-- Add more dropdown items as needed -->
           </ul>
       </li>
       <!-- Add more navigation items here -->
   </ul>
   ```

5. **Customize**: Open the `navbar/css/navbar.css` file and adjust the styles to match your website's design. You can modify colors, typography, spacing, and more.

6. **Smooth Scrolling**: To enable smooth scrolling to anchor points within the same page, add the `data-scroll` attribute to your navigation links and set the `href` attribute to the corresponding anchor ID:

   ```html
   <li class="nav-item"><a href="#section-1" data-scroll>Section 1</a></li>
   ```

7. **Test**: Open your HTML file in a browser and test the navigation bar. Ensure that the responsive design and dropdown menus work as expected.
